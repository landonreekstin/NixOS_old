This is my personal NixOS configuration for my home machines. The focus of this config is isolated development environments, security,
privacy, and gaming.

The goal of this configuration is to create modular and flexible configs for my desktop PC, laptop, mini-pc SBC, WSL2, and in the future, 
possibly embedded targets like the Beaglebone Black. I also intend for this config to be used by friends as an easy and stable way to use 
Linux on a personal desktop or laptop without needing extensive use of the shell.
